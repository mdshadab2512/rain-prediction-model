Rain_Prediction_Project

The project aims to predict possibility of rain in region of australia based on dataset attributes like pressure,humidity,sunshine at diiferent times.

i)   The dataset is taken from kaggle which contains a csv file name weatheraus.csv containing data from different region of australia

ii)  The machine learning model employed in the project are Decision Tree Classifier and Random Tree Classifier

iii) Dataset is divided into three set as training set,developement set and test set.

iv)  Datset is first trained on Decision Trees model where it shows overfitting as training error=0.01% and developement error= 20.8% which is reduced changes to training error=17.1%% and developement error= 16.6%

v)   To further reduce it ,dataset is trained on Random Trees followed by hyperparameter tuning which finally results in training error=0.01% and developement error= 14.7%
